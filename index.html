      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Edizon Ace Abad , and I am a passionate Computer Science enthusiast with a keen interest in coding, software development, and emerging technologies. I embarked on my journey into the world of technology at a young age, and ever since, I've been fascinated by the endless possibilities that computing offers.

        I hold a degree in Computer Science, where I’ve gained a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, artificial intelligence, web development, and software engineering. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve worked on a variety of projects that range from web applications to machine learning models, and I've also gained hands-on experience with languages like Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript.
        
        Beyond coding, I am particularly interested in areas such as cloud computing, cybersecurity, data science, and blockchain technology. I love solving complex problems and finding creative, efficient solutions. I also enjoy learning about the latest trends and innovations in technology, keeping up with developments in areas like artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
        
        In my free time, I work on personal projects, contribute to open-source software, and explore new programming languages and frameworks. I’m always excited to collaborate on new ideas and share knowledge with like-minded people.</p>
